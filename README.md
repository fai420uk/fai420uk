### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am actively looking forward to work as a Java developer in UK. All of my past experience was from Hong Kong but I am sure I have got most of the transferable skills could be applied here.

With over a decade of Java development experience, I have navigated the entire development lifecycle, from gathering requirements to deploying and testing solutions. My passion lies in tackling complex problems through code. I am eager to contribute my diverse skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic development team in our ever-evolving tech landscape.
