### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>I am actively looking forward to work as a Java developer in UK. All of my past experience was from Hong Kong but I believe my skills could be applied.</p>

<p>With over a decade of Java development experience, I have navigated the entire development lifecycle, from gathering requirements to deploying and testing solutions. My passion lies in tackling complex problems through code. I am eager to contribute my diverse skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic development team in our ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
